    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>A personal interest of mine that I've picked up recently is baking bread. I just really enjoy the process of mixing flour, water, yeast and salt into something very good. I really want to get into making sourdough, but that also seems super difficult.<br><br>
    Chess is a game that I am really bad at but still I find it interesting. Despite my lack of skill, I enjoy the mental challenge that chess presents. I like the way it requires you to think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves. Even though I lose most of the time, I enjoy playing and learning from my mistakes.<br><br>
    I also really enjoy playing different games with my roommates. Some of my personal favorites right now are Super Smash Bros., Magic: The Gathering, and Pokemon. I like to think I'm pretty good at all of these.</p>
